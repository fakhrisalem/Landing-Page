        <h2>Repairs Over Replacement</h2>
        <p>We approach every aspect of our business with sustainability in mind. That's why we believe it's always worth trying to fix a system before outright replacing it, wherever possible – it requires fewer materials and is easier on the planet, as well as your wallet! If another company tells you that your system needs to be replaced, just give us a call and we'll see if we can repair it first.</p>

        <p>As I'm sure you'll have seen, solar systems don't tend to come cheap. Our aim is to make solar power accessible to everyone, so we price ourselves in a way that makes solar energy more affordable. We're focused on helping you and on helping the environment, rather than on turning a profit.</p>
